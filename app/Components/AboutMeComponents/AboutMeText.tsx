        Hey there! My name is Brad and I build web experiences for the Minnesota
        Timberwolves & Lynx digital marketing team. I assume you want to know a
        little something about how I got here.
      </p>
      <p>
        My professional life used to be an amalgam of side gigs â€” I managed
        projects for a construction company, wrote copy for an e-commerce giant,
        and even detoured to law school! I taught myself web development a few
        years ago and finally found the spark I had been searching for. Coding
        enabled me to solve real-world problems, scratched my creative itch, and
        empowered me to learn constantly. I never looked back.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I use my writing chops, eye for design, and endless curiosity every
        day to build and design pixel-perfect websites. I have developed a knack
        for developing beautiful, performant, responsive React UIs.
