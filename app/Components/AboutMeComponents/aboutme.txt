Hello there! My name is Yannis and I'm a web developer based in London, UK. 
I've been around technology for as long as I remember and have always had a deep interest in creating things.

Prior to learning web development, I was a student at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. During my time there,
I learnt a lot about creativity, mindset and how I learn best. Although I love (and always will love) music, I felt that
I wanted to explore other creative avenues before commiting fully. That's when I started looking into programming.
Programming has allowed me to address real-world challenges, satisfy my creative cravings, and empowered me to learn constantly.

Now I use my creative skillset and endless curiosity on a daily basis to translate website designs into a reality.
